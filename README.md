# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Final peer-reviewed project for Getting and Cleaning Data for Johns Hopkins Coursera R specialisation.

This repository was created for the purpose of completing the peer-reviewed assignment of:

> Course 3: Getting And Cleaning Data, from Data Science Specialization, by Johns Hopkins University, on coursera

The course is taught by:

> - Jeff Leek, Phd
> - Roger D. Peng, Phd
> - Brian Caffo, Phd 

This is the mission state of the course instructors:
> The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The assignment was:
>You will be required to submit:
>
> 1. A tidy data set as described below
> 2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
> 3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

The main script, "run_analysis.R" meets the requirements to run, being that the "UCI HAR Dataset" is present in the working directory and can perform the following 5 steps:

> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
> 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
